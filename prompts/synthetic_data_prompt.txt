You are an expert data engineer tasked with creating a production-grade synthetic e-commerce data pack for an online recruitment assessment. Produce **seven** interrelated CSV files (600-1,200 rows each) plus a README that highlights assumptions, validation checks, and summary stats. Files must be UTF-8, comma-delimited, and obey the schemas below while remaining narratively consistent (e.g., campaigns drive orders, loyalty tiers affect marketing opt-in).

1. customers.csv
   - customer_id (UUID)
   - first_name
   - last_name
   - email (unique, realistic domains)
   - phone
   - created_at (ISO 8601 timestamp within the last 3 years)
   - marketing_opt_in (boolean)

   - loyalty_tier (bronze, silver, gold, platinum; distribution skewed toward bronze)
   - lifetime_value_bucket (low, medium, high; derive from total spent)

2. products.csv
   - product_id (UUID)
   - name
   - category (choose from electronics, apparel, home, beauty, sports)
   - brand
   - price (decimal, currency USD)
   - created_at (ISO 8601 timestamp within the last 3 years)
   - inventory_count (integer)
   - active_flag (boolean)

3. orders.csv
   - order_id (UUID)
   - customer_id (reference customers.csv)
   - order_date (ISO 8601 timestamp within the last 3 years)
   - order_status (pending, shipped, delivered, cancelled, returned)
   - shipping_address
   - shipping_city
   - shipping_state
   - shipping_postal_code
   - shipping_country (use US, CA, GB, AU)
   - subtotal (numeric)
   - shipping_cost (numeric)
   - tax_amount (numeric)
   - total_amount (subtotal + shipping_cost + tax_amount)
   - coupon_code (nullable)
   - marketing_campaign_id (nullable; reference marketing_campaigns.csv)

4. order_items.csv
   - order_item_id (UUID)
   - order_id (reference orders.csv)
   - product_id (reference products.csv)
   - quantity (1-5)
   - unit_price (match products.csv price)
   - discount_amount (numeric, default 0)
   - line_total (quantity * (unit_price - discount_amount))
   - tax_rate (percentage applied)

5. inventory_events.csv
   - event_id (UUID)
   - product_id (reference products.csv)
   - event_type (restock, sale, return, adjustment)
   - quantity_change (integer, negative for sales)
   - event_timestamp (ISO 8601 timestamp within the last 3 years)
   - note (short text)
   - actor (system, warehouse_bot, associate, vendor)

6. marketing_campaigns.csv
   - campaign_id (UUID)
   - name
   - channel (email, sms, social, paid_search, affiliate)
   - start_date
   - end_date
   - target_segment (map to loyalty tiers or regions)
   - spend (numeric)
   - conversions (number of orders attributed)

7. support_tickets.csv
   - ticket_id (UUID)
   - customer_id (reference customers.csv)
   - order_id (nullable, reference orders.csv)
   - opened_at
   - closed_at (nullable)
   - category (delivery, billing, product_quality, returns, general)
   - resolution_status (resolved, escalated, pending)
   - csat_score (1-5 integers, null if unresolved)

Guidelines:
- Ensure referential integrity across files.
- Use realistic-seeming names, addresses, and brands; avoid obviously fake placeholders.
- Vary timestamps to simulate real business activity; ensure chronological consistency (e.g., order_items must not predate their parent order).
- Distribute numeric values with realistic variation (e.g., pricing tiers by category, taxes derived from subtotal, discounts on a minority of items).
- Generate feature-consistent logic:
  - Inventory counts must reconcile with net inventory_events per product.
  - Loyalty tier upgrades occur only after spend thresholds (e.g., >$1k for gold).
  - Campaign attribution should align with coupon_code usage on orders.
  - Support tickets referencing orders must post-date the associated order_date.
- Add lightweight data quality checks in the README (duplicate checks, FK coverage, outlier notes).
- Provide dataset-level insights (row counts, spend distribution, top categories) in README tables or bullet lists.

Return the complete file contents and README. Conclude with a concise summary of how the data was validated and any known caveats.
